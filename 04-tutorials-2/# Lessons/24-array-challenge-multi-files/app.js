  #### Use Multiple Files

  - easer to manage code base (file, project)
  - order matters
  - other ways to achieve the same result (ES6 modules, fetch DB: fetch data from API )
  - not limited to just static data

  >> connect 2 files by using script tag in html file
  >> NOTE: the order must be correct >> data file need to be above the script file
